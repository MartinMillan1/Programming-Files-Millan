<div class="uk-column-1-2 aboutus">  <!--poner el gris un poco mas ampli-->
<p>We are a family business. Our father was a coffee lover or we could say a "CoffeeColic". He founded Kahve 10 years ago. Imagine being a child and smelling that gorgeous coffee smell everyday. My father used to tell my brothers and me the story of the coffee, and that woke our passion for the coffee. That's why at the beginning of this paragraph I wrote family business. My father founded and my brothers and I continue his dream.</p>
<p>We love coffee, we live for it. The world of the coffee is limitless. We imagine the coffee, making as an Art, and to make good Art you need the best materials. We select the beans we sell, we have our producers all around the world in the best areas to harvest the coffee.</p>
<p> Why Kahve? Kahve means coffee in Turkish. Our family name is Turkish so my father decided to honor the land of his father. My grandfather came from Turkey in the 70's. He settled down in Adelaide and got married. Mnay of the stories about coffee my father used to tell us, were stories that my granfather told him. My grandfather dreamed of dedicating himself to the coffee business but he couldn't. My father as a tribute put a Turkish name.</p>
<p> We all have dreams, we just have to dare to realize them. In each coffee bean we selectionate we do it with our heart. You don't know, maybe your next project begins with a cup of coffee, a pencil and a paper.</p>
